# Implementing transformers

> This is a learning repo where I will take notes on and implement LLM's from scratch, mainly for learning purposes. Essentially, it will collate notes, resources, and code implementations for learning about LLM's.

## Code repo structure


## Goal 

Implement [llama 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783) in JAX and train a mini version of it. Implement all the fancy techniques discussed in the linked paper.
